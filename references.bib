	title    = "The Earth Mover's Distance as a Metric for Image Retrieval",
	author   = "Rubner, Yossi and Tomasi, Carlo and Guibas, Leonidas J",
	abstract = "We investigate the properties of a metric between two
	distributions, the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), for
	content-based image retrieval. The EMD is based on the minimal
	cost that must be paid to transform one distribution into the
	other, in a precise sense, and was first proposed for certain
	vision problems by Peleg, Werman, and Rom. For image retrieval,
	we combine this idea with a representation scheme for
	distributions that is based on vector quantization. This
	combination leads to an image comparison framework that often
	accounts for perceptual similarity better than other previously
	proposed methods. The EMD is based on a solution to the
	transportation problem from linear optimization, for which
	efficient algorithms are available, and also allows naturally for
	partial matching. It is more robust than histogram matching
	techniques, in that it can operate on variable-length
	representations of the distributions that avoid quantization and
	other binning problems typical of histograms. When used to
	compare distributions with the same overall mass, the EMD is a
	true metric. In this paper we focus on applications to color and
	texture, and we compare the retrieval performance of the EMD with
	that of other distances.",

In this chapter and the next we look in detail at the Monte Carlo methods that have been used to investigate the properties of this model. As well as demonstrating the application of the basic principles described in the last chapter, the study of the using model provides an excellent introduction to the most important Monte Carlo algorithms in use today. Along the way we will also look at some of the tricks used for implementing Monte Carlo algorithms in computer programs and at some of the standard techniques used to analyse the data those programs generate.}",
